Day 3 Title:
🟦 Build a Zoo System Using Interfaces + Polymorphism

This continues abstraction + polymorphism, but with a new theme.

✨ The Challenge

Create a system where different animals can make sounds, but the zoo does not care which animal type they are.

You must use:

an interface Animal

multiple classes: Lion, Elephant, Monkey

a function playSounds(animals: Animal[]) that calls makeSound() for each

Goal:

Demonstrate polymorphism using interfaces — just like real zoo animals behave differently but follow the same rule: they must make a sound.
